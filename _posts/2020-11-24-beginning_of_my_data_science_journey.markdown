Hello! My name is Helen, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist who is currently enrolled in online self-paced data science bootcamp at Flatiron. I graduated from the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!!) with a BBA in Operations & Supply Chain Management in 2018. Currently, I am working in the accounting department at a fast-growing technology company in Atlanta as Product Billing Specialist. At my  job, I collect and analyze shipment information on each sale order to predict daily, weekly, and monthly revenues.

Personally, I have always liked taking a deep dive into data, analyzing data, and telling stories about data. I think that data helps us make better and quicker decisions that can be extremely crucial for any organizations. Since college, Excel was my first exposure to world of data. In addition, I am also familiar with Power BI and Tableau where I use these tools for data entry, analysis, and visualizations at work. 

When the global pandemic hit in March 2020, during lockdown, I wanted to learn something new to make my quarantine more productive. As I was researching to see which skills are in demand to make myself more competitive in the job market, I found out that Python, SQL, and R (or data analytics skills in general) are in high demand for all industries. In April 2020, I started to learn SQL and Python on DataCamp. If you are new to data world or if you want extra practice/exercises, I highly recommend checking out this website. Soon after, I looked into various data science degrees and bootcamps to choose the right option for me...and I heard about Flatiron School.

Knowing that data science field requires technical, calculus, statistics, and many other skills, it is not going to be easy  but it gives me an opportunity to combine everything I love into one. Joining this bootcamp is just the beginning. I am super excited for this challenge. I can't wait to see how I learn and grow throughout the program.
