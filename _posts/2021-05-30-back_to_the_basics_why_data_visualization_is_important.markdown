At Flatiron School, in all projects, there is always a requirement to have at least 4 meaningful visualizations. So, why is data visualization so important? And how does it help me to become a better data scientist? In this blog, I will use visualizations from my capstone project to explain this concept.

Pictures and visualizations of any kind have a more powerful impact on their audience than written words. This is because mentally, visuals are more strongly tied to memory. Visuals also reiterate your message in a unique way, strengthening their impact on your audience. Data visualization is the representation of data or information in a graph, chart, or other visual format.  It communicates relationships of the data with images. It allows trends and patterns to be more easily seen, especially when we have big datasets.

Impacts of Data Visualization

- Helps stakeholders focus on the areas that require attention. Let's say the executive team wants you to predict the demand of a certain product for next month. They might not be interested in the details of how you obtained data, cleaned your data, or any other technical aspects of your tasks. They want concrete and easy to understand numbers. The visual mediums in this case would definitely help them understand the key points in order to make decisions.

- Without data visualization, it is challenging to identify the correlations between the relationship of independent variables. By making sense of those independent variables, we can make better decisions. 


- It's almost impossible to make predictions without having the necessary information from the past and present. Trends and frequency over time tell us where we were, where we are, and where we can potentially go. 

Examples:

- Let's take a look at this horizontal bar chart below. Again, without seeing the dataset, cleaning data, or doing any technical tasks, we can easily understand what the chart is telling us about number of crimes in NYC.

- This line graph tells us the unemployment rate in NYC from 2015 - 2019. Unemployment percentage increased significantly during the periods 2009 - 2012 because of the great recession we had.

- Or in this image, we can immediately see the number of crimes has been decreasing for the past 5 years.

- If you just started (or even if you are a pro), here are some tools and libraries you can explore and use for visualizations in Python: matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, ggplot, and plotly.


In conclusion, data visualization is truly important for any career. Whether you use a basic bar graph or an intricate infographic, data visualization makes large amounts of numbers and statistics accessible to our target audience. Visualization can help you begin to ask the right questions, and it makes the data more memorable. Ultimately you won’t regret incorporating data visualization into your business plan and presentations. Now go out and use visualization to tell your stories in a way that’s both understandable and engaging!
